## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

I have organized my projects into separate folders based on the technology stack used. You can explore the different folders to see the projects I‚Äôve worked on using various technologies.

- **Basic_To_Mid_Projects**: Projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **React_Projects**: Projects that utilize libraries such as React.
- **Game_Projects**: Guided game projects.
- **Exploration_Projects**: Projects built with different tools, CDNs, and other technologies.

Feel free to check out the respective folders for more details and to see the code in action!
